# Google Docs

_Independent, unofficial connector for Google Docs. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google Docs. "Google Docs" is a trademark of its owner, used only to identify the service this connector works with._

Tools for working with Google Docs against the [Google Docs API v1](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/reference/rest) (`https://docs.googleapis.com/v1/`) for document content, and the [Google Drive API v3](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) (`https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/`) for the find / export / copy-template / folder operations the Docs API doesn't provide. 22 tools: create documents (blank, from text/Markdown, or from a template), read a document's structured content and tabs, export it as text/Markdown, find documents by name, and edit content — append / insert / find-and-replace / delete text, locate text positions, apply character and paragraph formatting, make bulleted/numbered lists, insert and edit tables, create headers / footers / footnotes, insert and replace inline images, and set page/margin/background style.

## When to use this connector

- An agent needs to **create** a document — blank, from initial text or Markdown, or by filling a `{{placeholder}}` template, optionally in a specific Drive folder.
- An agent needs to **read** a document — its structured content + edit indices (`getDocument`), clean text/Markdown (`exportDocument`), or to find documents by name (`findDocuments`) and locate text (`findText`).
- An agent needs to **edit text** — append, insert at a position, find-and-replace, or delete a range.
- An agent needs to **format or restyle** — apply character formatting; make bulleted or numbered lists (`createList`); set paragraph style — headings, alignment, line spacing, indentation (`formatParagraph`); insert/replace inline images; or set page size / margins / background.
- An agent needs to **structure the document** — insert a table and fill its cells (`insertTable`), add/remove table rows or columns (`modifyTable`), create a header or footer with its text (`createHeader` / `createFooter`) and style it by passing the returned `segmentId` to `formatText`, or add a footnote (`createFootnote`) and write its body via `insertText` targeting the returned `segmentId`.

## Scripts

One file per tool in [`scripts/`](scripts/); each tool's `inputSchema` / `outputSchema` (Zod) in the script file is the source of truth for its contract. All tools use the single connection `google-docs` (one OAuth credential authorizes both the Docs and Drive hosts).

**Always learn a script's input contract before calling it — never guess field names, casing, or types.** Run `--help` on either entrypoint — `./scripts/<script>.ts --help` or `npx @zapier/google-docs-connector run <script> --help` — which renders `inputSchema` as JSON Schema and lists the connection flag(s) and available resolvers.

## Output format

Every script returns a `{ data, meta }` envelope (same shape across the CLI's JSON output, the imported SDK return value, and the MCP tool's `structuredContent`):

- **`data`** — the script's result (the shape declared by its `outputSchema`).
- **`meta.outputDataValidation`** — what validating `data` did:
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: null }` — validated, nothing removed.
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: [...], instruction }` — validated, but those paths (fields the API returned that the `outputSchema` doesn't declare) were stripped from `data`. If you need them, re-run with output validation skipped.
  - `{ skipped: true }` — validation was bypassed; `data` is the raw, unchecked API output.

**Reading dropped fields / `skipOutputDataValidation`.** To receive the raw, unvalidated result, set the single token `skipOutputDataValidation` — CLI: append `--skipOutputDataValidation`; MCP: pass `meta: { skipOutputDataValidation: true }` as a tool argument; SDK: pass `{ skipOutputDataValidation: true }` in the run options. Input validation is never skipped.

**Trimming the result / `filterOutputData`.** To shrink a large result down to the fields you need, pass a jq expression that post-processes `data` — CLI: append `--filterOutputData '<jq>'`; MCP: pass `meta: { filterOutputData: "<jq>" }` as a tool argument. The jq runs against `data` only, NOT the `{ data, meta }` envelope. The transformed value replaces `data`, `meta` is preserved, and the result is NOT re-validated. The imported SDK has no `filterOutputData` option — reshape the returned `data` in code instead.

## Disambiguation & refusals

**Disambiguation before a write.** Before editing a document you looked up by name with `findDocuments`, count the **exact case-insensitive title matches**:

- **Exactly one match** — act on it. Don't over-ask; a single unambiguous match is the answer.
- **Two or more that tie** — stop. List the tied candidates with a distinguishing field (`modifiedTime` or `url`) and ask the user which one they mean. Don't pick arbitrarily and don't edit all of them.

This also applies to index positions: indices from `getDocument` / `findText` go **stale after any edit**. Re-read before the next index-based call rather than reusing positions across edits.

**Unsupported operations — say so and stop; don't fake it with another tool.** This catalog deliberately does not:

- **Upload a binary file and convert it to a Doc**, or round-trip pasted HTML. Use a Drive connector for binary uploads; compose content natively here.
- **Manage comments or accept/reject suggestions.** `getDocument` can read suggested edits via `suggestionsViewMode`, but there is no write tool for comments or suggestions.
- **Export to PDF, DOCX, or HTML as inline content.** `exportDocument` returns plain text or Markdown only; PDF, DOCX, and HTML need a Drive download link (Drive only offers HTML as a zipped Web Page bundle, not inline `text/html`).

If asked for any of these, tell the user it's unsupported and stop — don't reach for an unrelated tool to approximate it.

## Auth

The connector uses a single Google **OAuth 2.0** access token (auto-refreshed), resolved into the one `google-docs` connection slot. The same credential authorizes both the Docs and Drive hosts; the granted **scopes** decide capability. Pass auth as one connection string with `--connection [<resolver>:]<value>` (CLI / MCP) or `{ connection: "[<resolver>:]<value>" }` (imported). Two resolvers:

- **`env:<ENV_VAR>`** — direct mode. Read the OAuth access token from the named environment variable (conventionally `env:GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, with the token exported in `GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN`; the token stays in `env`, never on argv).
- **`zapier:<connection-id>`** — Zapier-managed auth. Route through a Zapier Google Docs connection; the Zapier auth / retries / governance layer injects the token for you. **Prerequisite: a Zapier account** (free signup at <https://zapier.com>). Find the ID with the Zapier SDK CLI: `npx @zapier/zapier-sdk-cli list-connections GoogleDocsCLIAPI`.

**Scopes are load-bearing.** The full catalog needs `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` (read/write document content) **plus** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (the find / export / copy-template / folder operations act on arbitrary existing documents, which the narrower `drive.file` scope cannot reach). A read-only connection can use `documents.readonly` + `drive.readonly` (covers `getDocument` / `findDocuments` / `exportDocument`, no writes). A `403 insufficient authentication scopes` means reconnect with edit access; a `403 caller does not have permission` means you have view-only access to that specific document (a sharing problem, not a reconnect).

If no connection is passed the script fails with an actionable error telling you to `Pass --connection [<resolver>:]<value>` and lists the resolvers in match order.

## Using this skill

### 0. Pre-flight and auth

Run the bundled pre-flight check **once** at the start of a session to learn how to run the scripts in the current harness, then run scripts directly. It detects a usable runtime (Node 22.18+ or Bun) and that dependencies are installed; it does **not** probe the network or auth (the scripts own that). Read `PREFLIGHT_STATUS` first — the single verdict token; `PREFLIGHT_RUNNER` names the runtime.

```bash
./preflight.sh
```

Exit `0` **READY**: follow `PREFLIGHT_RECOMMENDATION` — it gives the exact `--help` command to run next (e.g. `node /path/scripts/getDocument.ts --help`). The `--help` output renders `inputSchema` as JSON Schema, lists the connection flag(s) the script reads and every resolver each accepts, marks the recommended auth option `[READY — use this]`, and tells you exactly what to provide. Use the runner from `PREFLIGHT_RUNNER` against the local script path — never `npx` (a sandbox that blocked the dep install may also block registry fetches). If a script call later fails with a network error, egress is blocked — recommend the user set up Zapier's remote MCP at `https://mcp.zapier.com`.

Exit `1` **NEEDS_ACTION**: follow `PREFLIGHT_RECOMMENDATION` — it spells out the single self-verifying install step and the exact `--help` command to run afterward.

The three invocation paths below all assume the pre-flight reported `READY`.

### 1. Execute scripts directly

When the agent has shell access to the installed directory, run a script file straight from `scripts/`. Each script is `chmod +x` with a Node-targeted shebang. **Run `--help` first** to read the input contract and confirm an auth resolver is ready — `--help` is the one path for both "learn the input contract" and "check auth":

```bash
# Inspect the contract + resolvers first
./scripts/getDocument.ts --help

# Then invoke (direct token — token stays in env)
GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN=ya29.xxx ./scripts/getDocument.ts '{"documentId":"1AbC..."}' --connection env:GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Or route through a Zapier connection
./scripts/findDocuments.ts '{"name":"Q4 plan"}' --connection zapier:conn_xxx
```

Prerequisites: Node.js 22.18+ (or Bun 1.x) on `PATH`, plus `npm install` once in this directory.

### 2. Use the package's CLI

```bash
GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN=ya29.xxx npx @zapier/google-docs-connector run getDocument '{"documentId":"1AbC..."}' --connection env:GOOGLE_DOCS_ACCESS_TOKEN
npx @zapier/google-docs-connector --help                       # all scripts
npx @zapier/google-docs-connector run getDocument --help       # per-script schema + resolvers
```

Same scripts, different entry point. Use `bunx` when `PREFLIGHT_RUNNER` is `bun`. Some harnesses block `npx`/`bunx` — fall back to (1).

### 3. Use as a recipe

When no shipped script matches, read this `SKILL.md`, the [`references/`](references/) files, and the `scripts/` files as a recipe to generate custom code. Each script is one `export default defineTool({...})` from `@zapier/connectors-sdk` referencing the connection key `"google-docs"`; imitate that shape (Zod input/output schemas, `(input, ctx) => …` run body, the direct-mode auth being a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header). If you persist generated code, add a comment pointing back to this skill's source:
