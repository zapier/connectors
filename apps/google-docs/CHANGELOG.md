# @zapier/google-docs-connector

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 4859680: Fix regressions introduced by the canonical-template doc migration: drop leftover `<!-- TODO -->` markers that leaked into the live docs, restore each connector's real auth example (the connector's actual resolver and `<ENV_VAR>` / `<ENV_VAR_PREFIX>` placeholder, not the generic `env:<ENV_VAR>` template default), restore the app-specific `## Disambiguation & refusals` sections, and remove a duplicated legacy `## API quirks worth knowing` section that the canonical `## References` already covers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a63b649: Drop explicit Bun support and the standalone on-install build; require Node.js 22.18+ for the source-run (skill) route.

  The dependency route is unaffected — published tarballs ship a precompiled `dist/`, so connectors consumed as a dependency still run on any Node. For the source-run route, `preflight.sh` is removed: its readiness diagnostics (missing `node_modules`, sandbox writability, unsupported Node for type-stripping) now live in the `cli.js` entry point, which bails with an actionable `Connector setup needed:` recommendation. Per-connector `tsup`/`typescript` devDependencies and the `prepare` script are gone — the publish build runs at the monorepo root.
