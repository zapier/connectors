description: Agent-callable Google Ads tools — search campaigns, ad groups, and ads via GAQL, build performance reports, manage campaign status and budgets, and set up conversion tracking. Use when the user mentions Google Ads or wants to read or manage advertising campaigns, budgets, or reporting — even if they don't name Google Ads explicitly.
license: Elastic-2.0
compatibility: Run `npm install --omit=dev` in this directory, then `node cli.js`. The TypeScript source needs Node.js 22.18+; on older Node, run `cli.js` for build-it-yourself / prebuilt / alternative-runtime options.

# Google Ads

_Independent, unofficial connector for Google Ads. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google Ads. "Google Ads" is a trademark of its owner, used only to identify the service this connector works with._

Tools for working with a Google Ads account against the [Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/overview) (`https://googleads.googleapis.com/v23/`). Reads are expressed in **GAQL** (Google Ads Query Language) against the search endpoint; writes go through the per-resource mutate endpoints. 13 tools across account navigation, reads and reporting, and campaign / budget / conversion-tracking management. Google Ads organizes accounts as a hierarchy: a **manager (MCC)** account can operate **client** accounts beneath it. Most tools take the operating account's `customerId`, plus an optional `loginCustomerId` (the manager account) when the operating account is reached through a manager.

## When to use this

- **Resolve which account to act on** — list the accounts the connection can access, then (when access is through a manager) the client accounts beneath it.
- **Read campaigns, ad groups, and ads** — list them with status and budget, or run an arbitrary GAQL query for anything the structured reads don't cover.
- **Build performance reports** — pick a resource, the metrics to measure, and a date range.
- **Manage campaigns and budgets** — pause, enable, or remove a campaign; create or adjust a daily budget.
- **Set up conversion tracking** — list or create conversion actions (including the offline-conversion `UPLOAD_CLICKS` action).

## Setup

This is an [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) skill.

If the connector has not been installed as a skill yet, install it first with `npx skills add zapier/connectors --skill google-ads` (or your harness's own skill-install mechanism), then continue here. Installing the skill copies these files, not dependencies. Before running the CLI, a local MCP server, or `zapier-sdk` auth commands, run `npm install --omit=dev` here once. Importing the published package as a dependency in your own project instead? That `npm install` already resolves everything — see [`references/use-as-sdk.md`](references/use-as-sdk.md).

The connector runs on **Node.js 22.18+**. Pick the reference that matches how you're running it, and load it before doing anything else:

| You have...                                                                                                                                                                 | Load                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| An MCP-aware client — tools may already be loaded (e.g. `mcp__google-ads__<tool>`), or you can register a local server yourself (or guide the user to)                      | [`references/use-as-mcp.md`](references/use-as-mcp.md)       |
| Terminal / subprocess access (you can run `node`)                                                                                                                           | [`references/use-as-cli.md`](references/use-as-cli.md)       |
| Only your own code, importing this package as a dependency                                                                                                                  | [`references/use-as-sdk.md`](references/use-as-sdk.md)       |
| You have... no tool access, no terminal, no ability to import this package — you write your own code that calls the Google Ads API directly (e.g. a code-execution sandbox) | [`references/use-as-recipe.md`](references/use-as-recipe.md) |

## Scripts

All scripts use the single connection `google-ads`. Customer-scoped scripts take the operating account's `customerId` (digits only) and an optional `loginCustomerId` (the manager account, when access is through a manager).

| Script                                                                     | Script name               | Connections  | Description                                                                                   |

| [`scripts/listSearchableFields.ts`](scripts/listSearchableFields.ts)       | `listSearchableFields`    | `google-ads` | List the selectable / filterable / sortable fields for a resource (compose a `search` query). |
| [`scripts/listCampaigns.ts`](scripts/listCampaigns.ts)                     | `listCampaigns`           | `google-ads` | List campaigns with status, channel type, budget, and dates.                                  |
| [`scripts/listAdGroups.ts`](scripts/listAdGroups.ts)                       | `listAdGroups`            | `google-ads` | List ad groups, optionally scoped to one campaign.                                            |

| [`scripts/listConversionActions.ts`](scripts/listConversionActions.ts)     | `listConversionActions`   | `google-ads` | List the conversion actions configured on the account.                                        |
| [`scripts/getReport.ts`](scripts/getReport.ts)                             | `getReport`               | `google-ads` | Build a performance report: resource + metrics + segments over a date range.                  |
| [`scripts/setCampaignStatus.ts`](scripts/setCampaignStatus.ts)             | `setCampaignStatus`       | `google-ads` | Pause, enable, or remove a campaign.                                                          |
| [`scripts/createCampaignBudget.ts`](scripts/createCampaignBudget.ts)       | `createCampaignBudget`    | `google-ads` | Create a daily campaign budget (amount in micros).                                            |
| [`scripts/updateCampaignBudget.ts`](scripts/updateCampaignBudget.ts)       | `updateCampaignBudget`    | `google-ads` | Update an existing budget's amount, name, or delivery method.                                 |
| [`scripts/createConversionAction.ts`](scripts/createConversionAction.ts)   | `createConversionAction`  | `google-ads` | Create a conversion action (e.g. `UPLOAD_CLICKS` for offline tracking).                       |

**Learn a script's input contract before calling it — never guess field names, casing, or types.** Run `--help` on a script (`./scripts/<name>.ts --help` or `node cli.js run <name> --help`); it renders the `inputSchema` as JSON Schema and lists the connection flag and resolvers. Guessing the payload just produces a `ZodError` and wastes a round-trip.

## Disambiguation & refusals

- **Money is in micros.** Budgets, bids, and report cost metrics (`*_micros`) are 1,000,000 × the currency amount (e.g. $50.00 → `50000000`). The one exception is a conversion action's default value, which is plain currency. Don't report a `cost_micros` of 5,000,000 as "$5,000,000".
- **Act on ids, not names.** Writes (`setCampaignStatus`, `updateCampaignBudget`) take ids. Resolve a name to an id first with `listCampaigns` / `search`; if two campaigns share a name, list them with a distinguishing field (id, status, channel type) and confirm which one before acting — never silently pick.
- **Unsupported — decline, don't substitute.** This connector does **not** upload offline conversions or add members to a Customer Match audience (Google routes new API integrations to the separate Data Manager API for those), and does **not** create full campaigns or manage keywords / targeting / ad creatives. If asked, say it's unsupported rather than substituting another tool and reporting success. `createConversionAction` sets up the conversion _action_; it does not upload conversions.

## Auth

Every shape passes auth as one connection **selector**, not the secret — a `[<resolver>:]<value>` string. Every connector accepts `zapier:<connection-id>` (Zapier-managed auth — routes through Zapier's auth, retries, and governance layer); some also accept one or more direct-token resolvers (naming and count vary per connector) — check this connector's own resolvers rather than assuming. The `<resolver>:` prefix is optional; a bare value goes to the first resolver that claims it — a UUID-shaped bare value always claims `zapier:`. Each script declares the connections it needs and the resolvers each accepts. The exact syntax for passing a connection (and how to see this connector's resolver list) differs by shape — see the reference you loaded above.

Checking what's already configured first? Don't dump environment values to do it — `env` or `env | grep <name>` prints the value along with the name, leaking a live credential into the transcript if one is set. Check names only (`env | cut -d= -f1 | grep -i <name>`) or test a known name directly (`[ -n "$VAR_NAME" ]`).

No connection yet? Pick one — and follow the reference's own flow to obtain it; never just ask the user for a connection id or token as if they already have one memorized:

|                                      | Load                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pass the credential directly         | [`references/use-without-zapier.md`](references/use-without-zapier.md) |
| Route it through a Zapier connection | [`references/use-with-zapier.md`](references/use-with-zapier.md)       |

## Output format

Every script returns a `{ data, meta }` envelope:

- **`data`** — the script's result (the shape its `outputSchema` declares; see the reference you loaded above for how to inspect a script's exact schema in your shape).
- **`meta.outputDataValidation`** — what validating `data` did:
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: null }` — validated, nothing removed.
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: [...], instruction }` — validated, but those paths were stripped from `data`: fields the script returned from the API that the `outputSchema` doesn't declare. If you need them, re-run with output validation skipped.
  - `{ skipped: true }` — validation was bypassed; `data` is the raw, unchecked script output.

**Reading dropped fields / `skipOutputDataValidation`.** To receive the raw, unvalidated result, opt out of output validation (the exact syntax differs by shape — see the reference you loaded above). Input validation is never skipped.

**Trimming the result / `filterOutputData`.** To shrink a large result down to the fields you need, pass a jq expression that post-processes `data` (again, exact syntax per shape). The jq runs against `data` only, NOT the `{ data, meta }` envelope, so write it rooted at `data` (run the script's `--help` — or your shape's equivalent — to see its output schema). The transformed value replaces `data`, `meta` is preserved, and the result is NOT re-validated against the output schema.
