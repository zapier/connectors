# Google Tasks

_Independent, unofficial connector for Google Tasks. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google Tasks. "Google Tasks" is a trademark of its owner, used only to identify the service this connector works with._

Agent-callable tools for Google Tasks (the [Google Tasks API v1](https://developers.google.com/workspace/tasks/reference/rest)). Manage **task lists** (list, get, create, rename, delete) and **tasks** (list, find by title, get, create, update, complete/reopen, reorder/reparent/move, delete, and clear completed). Authenticate once with a Zapier-managed Google connection (recommended) or a direct OAuth token. The connector exposes the full task surface as 13 single-purpose scripts with stable, predictable I/O — no triggers (it is non-polling).

## When to use this

- **Capture and organize to-dos** — create tasks (optionally as subtasks or at a position), create and rename task lists.
- **Review what's on a list** — list active (or completed) tasks, find a task by title, get a task's details.
- **Move work forward** — mark tasks complete or reopen them, reorder or reparent tasks, move a task to another list.
- **Prune** — delete a task or list, or clear (hide) all completed tasks in a list.
- Use whenever the user wants to manage Google Tasks or their to-do list, even if they don't name Google Tasks explicitly.

## Setup

This is an [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) skill.

**If this connector is already exposed to you as callable tools** (e.g. `mcp__google-tasks__<tool>`), that's a valid path — call them directly. Everything below is only for standalone terminal use when no such tools are loaded.

If the connector has not been installed as a skill yet, install it first with `npx skills add zapier/connectors --skill google-tasks` (or your harness's own skill-install mechanism), then continue here.

The connector runs on **Node.js 22.18+**. Pick the reference that matches how you're running it, and load it before doing anything else:

| You have...                                                                                                                                                       | Load                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| An MCP-aware client — tools may already be loaded (e.g. `mcp__google-tasks__<tool>`), or you can register a local server yourself (or guide the user to)          | [`references/use-as-mcp.md`](references/use-as-mcp.md)       |
| Terminal / subprocess access (you can run `node`)                                                                                                                 | [`references/use-as-cli.md`](references/use-as-cli.md)       |
| Only your own code, importing this package as a dependency                                                                                                        | [`references/use-as-sdk.md`](references/use-as-sdk.md)       |
| No tool access, no terminal, no ability to import this package — you write your own code that calls the Google Tasks API directly (e.g. a code-execution sandbox) | [`references/use-as-recipe.md`](references/use-as-recipe.md) |

## Scripts

All scripts use a single `google-tasks` connection.

| Script                           | Script name           | Connections    | Description                                                                               |

| `scripts/createTaskList.ts`      | `createTaskList`      | `google-tasks` | Create a new task list.                                                                   |
| `scripts/updateTaskList.ts`      | `updateTaskList`      | `google-tasks` | Rename a task list (title is the only editable field).                                    |
| `scripts/deleteTaskList.ts`      | `deleteTaskList`      | `google-tasks` | Delete a task list and all tasks in it (irreversible).                                    |
| `scripts/listTasks.ts`           | `listTasks`           | `google-tasks` | List/search tasks in a list; active-only by default, with completion/due/updated filters. |
| `scripts/findTask.ts`            | `findTask`            | `google-tasks` | Find a task in a list by title (exact match preferred). Resolves a title to a task id.    |
| `scripts/getTask.ts`             | `getTask`             | `google-tasks` | Get a single task by id.                                                                  |
| `scripts/createTask.ts`          | `createTask`          | `google-tasks` | Create a task (optionally a subtask / at a position).                                     |

| `scripts/clearCompletedTasks.ts` | `clearCompletedTasks` | `google-tasks` | Hide all completed tasks in a list (recoverable; non-destructive).                        |

## Auth

Every shape passes auth as one connection **selector**, not the secret — a `[<resolver>:]<value>` string. Every connector accepts `zapier:<connection-id>` (Zapier-managed auth — routes through Zapier's auth, retries, and governance layer); some also accept one or more direct-token resolvers (naming and count vary per connector) — check this connector's own resolvers rather than assuming. The `<resolver>:` prefix is optional; a bare value goes to the first resolver that claims it. Each script declares the connections it needs and the resolvers each accepts. The exact syntax for passing a connection (and how to see this connector's resolver list) differs by shape — see the reference you loaded above.

Google Tasks uses Google **OAuth 2.0** (scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` — full read/write; the read-only scope `…/auth/tasks.readonly` covers only the list/get tools). One connection slot, `google-tasks`, with two modes:

- **Zapier-managed (recommended) — `zapier:<connection-id>`.** Select the Google Tasks connection by id (`GOOGLE_TASKS_ZAPIER_CONNECTION_ID`). Zapier injects the credential per request and handles token refresh, retries, and governance — nothing expires on you.
- **Direct token — `env:GOOGLE_TASKS_ACCESS_TOKEN`.** A Google OAuth access token, sent as a bearer header. Note: Google access tokens expire ~1 hour after issue and this mode does **not** refresh them, so it suits short-lived/testing use; prefer the Zapier-managed connection for anything ongoing.
- `GOOGLE_TASKS_REFRESH_TOKEN` / `GOOGLE_TASKS_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_TASKS_CLIENT_SECRET` are **reserved for a future refresh-capable direct mode and are not used in this version.**

## Output format

Every script returns a `{ data, meta }` envelope:

- **`data`** — the script's result (the shape its `outputSchema` declares; see the reference you loaded above for how to inspect a script's exact schema in your shape).
- **`meta.outputDataValidation`** — what validating `data` did:
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: null }` — validated, nothing removed.
  - `{ skipped: false, droppedPaths: [...], instruction }` — validated, but those paths were stripped from `data`: fields the script returned from the API that the `outputSchema` doesn't declare. If you need them, re-run with output validation skipped.
  - `{ skipped: true }` — validation was bypassed; `data` is the raw, unchecked script output.

**Reading dropped fields / `skipOutputDataValidation`.** To receive the raw, unvalidated result, opt out of output validation (the exact syntax differs by shape — see the reference you loaded above). Input validation is never skipped.

**Trimming the result / `filterOutputData`.** To shrink a large result down to the fields you need, pass a jq expression that post-processes `data` (again, exact syntax per shape). The jq runs against `data` only, NOT the `{ data, meta }` envelope, so write it rooted at `data` (run the script's `--help` — or your shape's equivalent — to see its output schema). The transformed value replaces `data`, `meta` is preserved, and the result is NOT re-validated against the output schema.

## Disambiguation & refusals

- **Resolving a task or list by name.** Before updating, completing, moving, or deleting a task referenced by title, resolve it first — `findTask` returns the best title match, or `listTasks` to see candidates. If two or more tasks in the list have the **same title** (exact, case-insensitive), don't silently pick one: list the tied candidates with a distinguishing field (due date, status, notes) and ask which one. If exactly one matches, act on it — don't over-ask. Same rule for `listTaskLists` when a list is named.
- **Unsupported operations — say so, don't fake it.** This connector cannot: create or edit **recurring** tasks (the API has no recurrence fields — recurrence is managed only in the Google Tasks app), set a task's **time of day or reminder** (`due` is date-only — the time is discarded), or reorder by writing `position` (use `moveTask`). If asked for one of these, say it's unsupported and stop — do not substitute another tool and report success for something you didn't do.
