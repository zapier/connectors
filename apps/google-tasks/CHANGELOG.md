# @zapier/google-tasks-connector

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a63b649: Drop explicit Bun support and the standalone on-install build; require Node.js 22.18+ for the source-run (skill) route.

  The dependency route is unaffected — published tarballs ship a precompiled `dist/`, so connectors consumed as a dependency still run on any Node. For the source-run route, `preflight.sh` is removed: its readiness diagnostics (missing `node_modules`, sandbox writability, unsupported Node for type-stripping) now live in the `cli.js` entry point, which bails with an actionable `Connector setup needed:` recommendation. Per-connector `tsup`/`typescript` devDependencies and the `prepare` script are gone — the publish build runs at the monorepo root.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d884cf4]

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 54f299e: Publish `@zapier/google-tasks-connector` publicly (flip `publishConfig.access` to `public`), so it ships to the public npm registry and opts into the GitHub mirror alongside the other public connectors.
